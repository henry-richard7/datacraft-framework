# Datacraft Framework

A framework that eliminates the dependency on Apache Spark by leveraging delta-rs for the creation and management of Delta Lake tables. This framework follows Medallion architecture.

# Libraries

- **Polars** : For reading and writing delta lake tables.
- **SqlModel** : For storing and reading configurations from database tables.
- **Niquests** : For API requests.
